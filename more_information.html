            <h3>Who are we and how does our scheme work</h3>
            <p>We are a non-profit organisation that is passionate about helping the next generation of STEM students.
                Tutoring is principally an expensive luxury, only affordable and accessible to a subset of those that
                could benefit from it. That is why we make tutoring free, which we are able to do
                through voluntary tutors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tutoring in-person also
                has its limitations: namely the need to have tutors geographically nearby, and the need to travel for
                tutors or tutees. Both of these alone often mean that tutoring is
                impractical if not impossible. By providing tutoring online through the use of video
                call applications with the ability to screen share, we make tutoring effortless and
                convenient for both tutor and tutee, and thus enable those from different locations throughout
                the UK to connect.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Who are our tutors</h3>
            <p> Our tutors can be anyone that has evidenced expertise in one or more STEM subjects. We hope to
                attract individuals seeking volunteering opportunities in order to gain valuable skills and experience.
                Furthermore we hope to provide an insight to those thinking of possibly
                entering the teaching profession.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bulk of our tutors tend to always be STEM undergraduates
                , however many of our tutors are also retired teachers or STEM professionals, and in general include any
                individuals that are keen to offer their expertise and time in assisting students in need of help with
                their
                studies.

            <h3>Why be a tutor</h3>
            <p>By becoming a tutor, you are providing a student with an invaluable service, one which
                ordinarily they could not access and or afford. By receiving dedicated 1-to-1 assistance on a
                topic or problem tailored to their needs, a student can thrive, in
                a STEM subject, paving the way for them to succeed in it academically and also pursue a degree and
                or
                career
                in the subject as an adult. Further to this, such a positive learning experience with a tutor
                skilled in
                a
                STEM subject, can inspire a student to pursue a STEM career.
            </p>

            <p>
                Tutoring offers tutors a great opportunity to
                develop their professional skills and qualities, and will also give them great satisfaction in being
                able to
                help students solve their problems.
            </p>

            <h3>How do the tutor sessions work</h3>
            <p>Tutors register via the <a href="tutor_application_form.html">tutor application form</a>, and indicate
                when each week and in what subjects
                they will be available to tutor. Students can, after consulting the <a href="timetable.html">tutor
                    availability timetable</a>,
                book
                a
                session at least 48hrs in advance, by submitting the <a href="tutor_booking_form.html">book a session
                    form</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the form the student will provide a short description of
                the topic or problem in a STEM subject they wish to discuss with a tutor. They will then receive
                within 24hrs an email confirming whether or not a tutor is available. A
                suitable available tutor will then be notified of a booking, and be informed of the topic the
                student
                wants
                to cover. On the day of the tutoring session the tutor will need to arrange a video call, and
                the tutee will be emailed an invitation link to join. The tutor will then commence their prepared
                session
                which will last for approximately a maximum of one
                hour.
